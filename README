Hypertable JDBC Driver v0.1

This package contains the necessary classes to connect to an existing Hypertable instance
via the JDBC interfaces. The motivation behind this project was to visually view and query Hypertable
using the GUI database explorers that use JDBC as the connector.

I have tested this package with two SQL browsers:
1) The Eclipse Data Source Explorer (comes with DTP plugin set)
2) SQLWorkBench - http://www.sql-workbench.net/

#2 is a smaller, more standalone, java only package which is great for those who want to quickly get up and running
with testing this JDBC interface.

Installation:

1) Simply get the hypertable-jdbc_0.9.x.tar which contains a set of jar files, one of which being the JDBC driver itself. It's
important that when configuring the GUI explorer to use Hypertable, that *all* the extracted jar files be included in the driver path.
2) Start querying using HQL!
3) Report bugs using the issue tracker at http://github.com/ANithian/hyperjdbc

NOTE:
- The tar file reflects the version of hypertable with which this JDBC driver is compatible.
- Version 0.1 (first version uploaded) works with 0.9.3.x and does not have namespace support
- Version 0,9.4.x of the driver has support for namespaces (for which you must specify one). Namespaces
are specified in the URL as follows:
jdbc:hypertable://host:port/namespace/sub-namespace...
    * If your namespace starts with '/' then simply include the '/' in the beginning. The driver will strip
    the first '/' from the URI path and that becomes the namespace. This allows for connecting to namespaces that
    start with and without the '/'.
    * Once you connet to a namespace, to connect to another namespace, you have to close and re-open your connection using
    a new URL. Hypertable doesn't yet support selecting from a table in a different namespace from the one you 'use'd or connected
    to already.
