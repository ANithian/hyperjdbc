Hypertable JDBC Driver v0.1

This package contains the necessary classes to connect to an existing Hypertable instance
via the JDBC interfaces. The motivation behind this project was to visually view and query Hypertable
using the GUI database explorers that use JDBC as the connector.

I have tested this package with two SQL browsers:
1) The Eclipse Data Source Explorer (comes with DTP plugin set)
2) SQLWorkBench - http://www.sql-workbench.net/

#2 is a smaller, more standalone, java only package which is great for those who want to quickly get up and running
with testing this JDBC interface.

Installation:

1) Simply get the hypertable-jdbc_0.1.tar which contains a set of jar files, one of which being the JDBC driver itself. It's
important that when configuring the GUI explorer to use Hypertable, that *all* the extracted jar files be included in the driver path.
2) Start querying using HQL!
3) Report bugs using the issue tracker at http://github.com/ANithian/hyperjdbc
